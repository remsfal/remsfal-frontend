# Dependency Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the dependency cleanup performed to address security vulnerabilities and deprecated package warnings.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities (2 high severity) 
- **ip package**: SSRF improper categorization in isPublic vulnerability
- **Source**: @vue/devtools → @vue/devtools-electron → ip@2.0.1  
- **Resolution**: Removed @vue/devtools from devDependencies since it's not critical for production builds

### 2. Deprecated Package Warnings (Partially Addressed)
- **rimraf@3.0.2**: "Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported"
  - **Source**: nyc@17.1.0 and @cypress/code-coverage@3.14.6 → nyc@15.1.0
  - **Status**: Warning remains as requested by user to keep Cypress E2E testing and coverage merging
- **boolean@3.2.0**: "Package no longer supported"  
  - **Resolution**: Automatically eliminated when updating other packages

### 3. Updated Dependencies
Updated numerous packages to their latest stable versions:
- FontAwesome packages: 6.7.1/6.7.2 → 6.7.2
- PrimeVue ecosystem: 4.3.7 → 4.3.9
- ESLint plugins and tools: Updated to latest versions

- `cypress@14.5.4` - Restored E2E testing framework  
- `nyc@17.1.0` - Restored coverage merging tool

### Kept Removed (Security Fix)
- `@vue/devtools@8.0.1` - Removed to eliminate security vulnerability via ip package

### Updated Dependencies
- `@stylistic/eslint-plugin-js@4.4.1` → `@stylistic/eslint-plugin@2.13.0`

### Scripts Restored
- `coverage`: Restored to use complex merge script for Vitest + Cypress coverage
- `test`: Now runs both unit tests and E2E tests
- `cypress`: Restored to open Cypress interface
- `test:e2e` and `test:e2e:dev`: Restored E2E testing commands

### Configuration Restored
