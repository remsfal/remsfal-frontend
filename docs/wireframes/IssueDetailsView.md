# Issue Details View - Wireframe

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-06  
**Type:** Conceptual Mockup (Non-Implementation)  
**Design Reference:** ProjectSettings View

---

## Overview

This wireframe defines the structural layout for the **Issue Details View** using a card-based design pattern consistent with the ProjectSettings view. All sections use PrimeVue Card components with TailwindCSS utility classes.

**Backend Schema Alignment:**
- Field names and types match the OpenAPI schema definitions from `ticketing-schema.ts`
- Uses `IssueJson` schema fields:
  - `id` (UUID) - Issue identifier
  - `title` (string) - Issue title
  - `description` (string) - Issue description
  - `type` (Type enum: APPLICATION | TASK | DEFECT | MAINTENANCE)
  - `status` (Status enum: PENDING | OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | CLOSED | REJECTED)
  - `ownerId` (UUID) - Issue owner/assignee
  - `reporterId` (UUID) - Issue reporter
  - `projectId` (UUID) - Associated project
  - `tenancyId` (UUID) - Optional tenancy reference
  - `blockedBy` (UUID) - Single issue blocking this one
  - `relatedTo` (UUID) - Single related issue
  - `duplicateOf` (UUID) - Single duplicate issue reference
- Project references use `ProjectItemJson` structure (id, name, memberRole)
- User roles follow `MemberRole` enum values (PROPRIETOR, MANAGER, LESSOR, STAFF, COLLABORATOR)
- Chat/communication endpoint: `/ticketing/v1/issues/{issueId}/chats`

**Navigation:**
- Breadcrumb navigation and previous/next issue navigation are **optional future enhancements**
- Current wireframe includes a "Back" button for basic navigation

## Layout Structure

### Page Container
```
<main class="grid grid-cols-12 gap-4">
  <!-- All cards span full width: col-span-12 -->
</main>
```

---

## Card Sections

### 1. Issue Overview Card

**Purpose:** Display key issue identification and status information at a glance.

**Structure:**
```
Card (class="flex flex-col gap-4 basis-full")
├── Title: "Issue Overview" (font-semibold text-xl)
└── Content:
    ├── Issue ID: [Placeholder: UUID from IssueJson.id]
    ├── Issue Title: [Placeholder: "Fix login authentication bug" - IssueJson.title]
    └── Current Status: [Badge: OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | CLOSED | PENDING | REJECTED]
        └── Maps to: IssueJson.status (Status enum)
```

**Placeholder Fields:**
- Issue ID → `id` (UUID, read-only, auto-generated)
- Issue Title → `title` (string, editable)
- Status → `status` (Status enum: PENDING, OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, CLOSED, REJECTED)

---

### 2. Issue Description Card

**Purpose:** Display detailed issue description with markdown support.

**Structure:**
```
Card (class="flex flex-col gap-4 basis-full")
├── Title: "Description" (font-semibold text-xl)
└── Content:
    ├── Markdown Preview Area
    │   └── [Placeholder: Rich text formatted content with headers, lists, code blocks]
    └── Edit Button (icon="pi pi-pencil")
```

**Placeholder Fields:**
- Description text → `description` (string, markdown-enabled)
- Edit/Preview toggle functionality (placeholder only)

**Note:** The `description` field in IssueJson supports markdown formatting. Markdown rendering component to be determined (e.g., vue-markdown or similar).

---

### 3. Metadata Card

**Purpose:** Display issue metadata including people, dates, and classification.

**Structure:**
```
Card (class="flex flex-col gap-4 basis-full")
├── Title: "Metadata" (font-semibold text-xl)
└── Content: (grid layout for field-value pairs)
    ├── Reporter: [Placeholder: "John Doe" with avatar icon]
    │   └── Maps to: IssueJson.reporterId (UUID, optional)
    ├── Owner/Assignee: [Placeholder: "Jane Smith" with avatar + dropdown]
    │   └── Maps to: IssueJson.ownerId (UUID, optional)
    ├── Project: [Placeholder: "Building A Renovation" - read-only link]
    │   └── Maps to: IssueJson.projectId (UUID, displayed via ProjectItemJson)
    ├── Issue Type: [Placeholder: "TASK" - badge or label]
    │   └── Maps to: IssueJson.type (Type enum: APPLICATION | TASK | DEFECT | MAINTENANCE)
    ├── Status: [Placeholder: "IN_PROGRESS" - colored badge]
    │   └── Maps to: IssueJson.status (Status enum: PENDING | OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | CLOSED | REJECTED)
    ├── Tenancy: [Placeholder: "Apartment 3B - Smith Family" - optional link]
    │   └── Maps to: IssueJson.tenancyId (UUID, optional)
    ├── Created At: [Placeholder: "2025-12-01 10:30:00"]
    │   └── Backend timestamp field (not in IssueJson - from audit metadata)
    └── Last Modified: [Placeholder: "2025-12-05 14:22:15"]
        └── Backend timestamp field (not in IssueJson - from audit metadata)
```

**Placeholder Fields:**
- Reporter → `reporterId` (UUID, optional - resolves to user with avatar)
- Owner/Assignee → `ownerId` (UUID, optional - user dropdown/autocomplete)
- Project → `projectId` (UUID, optional - displayed using ProjectItemJson structure with name and memberRole)
- Issue Type → `type` (Type enum: APPLICATION, TASK, DEFECT, MAINTENANCE - displayed as badge)
- Status → `status` (Status enum: PENDING, OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, CLOSED, REJECTED - colored badge)
- Tenancy → `tenancyId` (UUID, optional - links to associated tenancy)
- Created timestamp (from backend audit metadata)
- Modified timestamp (from backend audit metadata)

**Schema Notes:**
- All UUID fields are optional in IssueJson
- "Assignee" in UI terminology maps to `ownerId` field in backend schema
- ProjectItemJson provides: `id` (UUID), `name` (string), `memberRole` (MemberRole enum)

---

### 4. Relations Card

**Purpose:** Manage relationships between issues (blocks, duplicates, related).

**Important Schema Note:**  
In `IssueJson`, the relation fields (`blockedBy`, `relatedTo`, `duplicateOf`) each store a **single UUID**, not an array. The wireframe shows multiple items for UI illustration purposes, but the backend currently supports only one relation per type.

**Structure:**
```
Card (class="flex flex-col gap-4 basis-full")
├── Title: "Related Issues" (font-semibold text-xl)
└── Content:
    ├── Section: "Blocks" (collapsed by default)
    │   ├── Note: "Issues that this issue blocks (reverse lookup, not in IssueJson)"
    │   ├── List placeholder: Display issues where their blockedBy field equals this issue's ID
    │   └── Action: [Informational only - managed from blocked issues]
    │
    ├── Section: "Blocked By" (collapsed by default)
    │   ├── Maps to: IssueJson.blockedBy (single UUID, optional)
    │   ├── Placeholder: "#ISSUE-89: Setup Redis caching infrastructure"
    │   │   └── Status badge: IN_PROGRESS | Owner: M. Schmidt
    │   └── Action: [Change/Remove button to update blockedBy field]
    │
    ├── Section: "Duplicate Of" (collapsed by default)
    │   ├── Maps to: IssueJson.duplicateOf (single UUID, optional)
    │   ├── Placeholder: "#ISSUE-67: Fix authentication timeout on login page"
    │   │   └── Status badge: CLOSED
    │   └── Action: [Change/Remove button - sets this issue to duplicate]
    │
    └── Section: "Related To" (collapsed by default)
        ├── Maps to: IssueJson.relatedTo (single UUID, optional)
        ├── Placeholder: "#ISSUE-201: Update user documentation for login flow"
        │   └── Status badge: OPEN
        └── Action: [Change/Remove button to update relatedTo field]
```

**Example Placeholder Content:**

**Blocks Section (Reverse Lookup):**
- This section shows issues that are blocked by THIS issue
- Populated by querying other issues where their `blockedBy` UUID equals this issue's `id`
- Example: "#ISSUE-156: Implement OAuth2 token refresh mechanism" (IN_PROGRESS)
- Not directly stored in this issue's IssueJson

**Blocked By Section:**
- Maps to: IssueJson.blockedBy (single UUID)
- Example: #ISSUE-89: Setup Redis caching infrastructure (IN_PROGRESS) - Owner: M. Schmidt
- Action: Change or remove the blocking issue reference

**Duplicate Of Section:**
- Maps to: IssueJson.duplicateOf (single UUID)
- Example: #ISSUE-67: Fix authentication timeout on login page (CLOSED)
- Note: Marking as duplicate may auto-close this issue

**Related To Section:**
- Maps to: IssueJson.relatedTo (single UUID)
- Example: #ISSUE-201: Update user documentation for login flow (OPEN)
- Action: Change or remove the related issue reference

**Placeholder Elements:**
- Accordion/Expandable sections for each relation type
- Issue reference with clickable link to navigate to related issue
- Status badges showing current state of related issues
- Change/Remove action buttons to modify relation fields
- Empty state messaging when no relation is set

**Backend Schema Constraints:**
- Each relation type (`blockedBy`, `relatedTo`, `duplicateOf`) stores only a **single UUID**
- "Blocks" section requires reverse lookup (query issues where their `blockedBy` equals this issue's `id`)
- All relation fields are optional in IssueJson

---

### 5. Chats Section (PrimeVue TabView Concept)

**Purpose:** Display different communication channels using tabbed interface.

**Backend Integration:**
- Endpoint: `GET /ticketing/v1/issues/{issueId}/chats`
- Returns chat sessions for the issue
- Schema details to be determined (currently returns `unknown` type in API spec)

**Structure:**
```

## Visual Design Guidelines

### Card Styling
- **Container:** `Card` component from PrimeVue
- **Layout:** `class="flex flex-col gap-4 basis-full"`
- **Spacing:** Consistent `gap-4` between elements
- **Typography:**
  - Card titles: `font-semibold text-xl`
  - Field labels: `font-medium text-gray-700`
  - Values: Regular text weight

### Colors & States
- **Primary Actions:** Default PrimeVue button styling
- **Status Badges** (from Status enum: PENDING | OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | CLOSED | REJECTED):
  - PENDING: Gray/Neutral color
  - OPEN: Blue/Info color
  - IN_PROGRESS: Orange/Warning color
  - CLOSED: Green/Success color
  - REJECTED: Red/Danger color
- **Type Badges** (from Type enum: APPLICATION | TASK | DEFECT | MAINTENANCE):
  - APPLICATION: Purple/Primary color
  - TASK: Blue/Info color
  - DEFECT: Red/Danger color
  - MAINTENANCE: Orange/Warning color

### Responsive Behavior
- All cards: `col-span-12` (full width)
- Use PrimeVue's responsive components
- Stack elements vertically on mobile

---

## Questions / Assumptions

### 1. **Issue Relations Management**
**Question:** The backend schema (`IssueJson`) currently stores only **single UUIDs** for relations (`blockedBy`, `relatedTo`, `duplicateOf`). Should the UI support:
- (A) Only one relation per type (matching backend schema exactly)?
- (B) Multiple relations per type (requiring backend schema expansion to arrays)?
- (C) A "Blocks" section via reverse lookup (querying issues where their `blockedBy` equals this issue's ID)?

**Current Assumption:** Using single relations as defined in IssueJson schema. "Blocks" section would require reverse lookup query.

---

### 2. **Markdown Editor vs. Preview**
**Question:** For the Description Card, should there be inline editing with live preview, or separate Edit/Preview modes? Should we use a specific markdown library recommendation?

**Current Assumption:** Using a toggle between Preview and Edit modes, similar to GitHub's issue description editor pattern.

---

### 3. **Communication Tabs**
**Question:** Are "Comments" and "Activity Log" the only two tabs needed, or should we plan for additional tabs like "Attachments" or "History"?

**Current Assumption:** Two tabs only (Comments, Activity Log) based on common issue tracking patterns. Activity log auto-generates from system events.

---

### 4. **Permissions & Edit Controls**
**Question:** Should edit permissions be field-level (e.g., only assignees can change status) or role-based at the view level? How should read-only states be indicated?

**Current Assumption:** All fields are editable for demonstration purposes. Actual permissions will be enforced by backend and reflected in UI.

---

### 5. **Navigation & Context (Optional Future Enhancement)**
**Question:** Should this view include breadcrumb navigation showing Project > Issues > [Issue Title]? Should there be "Previous/Next Issue" navigation buttons?

**Current Assumption:** Including a "Back" button (as in IssueEdit.vue) for basic navigation. Breadcrumb navigation and previous/next issue navigation are considered **optional future enhancements** and are not included in this initial wireframe. These can be added to the layout wrapper when needed.

---

### 6. **Real-time Updates**
**Question:** Should the Activity Log and Comments sections support real-time updates (e.g., WebSocket), or is manual refresh/polling sufficient?

**Current Assumption:** Manual refresh for this wireframe. Real-time updates are a future enhancement requiring backend support.

---

### 7. **Chat/Comments Schema**
**Question:** The chat endpoint (`GET /ticketing/v1/issues/{issueId}/chats`) currently returns type `unknown` in the schema. What is the expected structure for:
- Chat messages (user, timestamp, content, attachments)?
- Activity log entries (action type, actor, timestamp, changes)?
- Should comments support threading/replies?

**Current Assumption:** Placeholder structure with user info, timestamps, and text content. Actual schema needs definition.

---

### 8. **Attachment Handling**
**Question:** Should attachments be part of the "Future Fields" section, or should they have a dedicated card/tab in the initial implementation?

**Current Assumption:** Attachments are deferred to "Future Fields" section. If needed urgently, they can be added as a new card or integrated into the Comments tab.

---

## Implementation Notes (For Future Development)

- This wireframe should **NOT** be implemented as code yet
- Component selection (markdown editor, avatar components) pending decision
- Data fetching strategy (single endpoint vs. multiple) to be determined
- Form validation rules to be defined based on backend API schema
- Internationalization (i18n) keys to be added during implementation phase
- All placeholder text should be replaced with actual i18n keys
- **Backend Schema Constraints:**
  - IssueJson relation fields (`blockedBy`, `relatedTo`, `duplicateOf`) are single UUIDs, not arrays
  - Chat/message schema needs definition (currently `unknown` type)
  - All IssueJson fields are optional except for constraints defined in backend validation

- **IssueDescriptionCard.vue**: Displays `description` with markdown support
- **IssueMetadataCard.vue**: Displays all metadata fields (reporter, owner, project, type, status, tenancy, timestamps)
- **IssueRelationsCard.vue**: Manages relations (`blockedBy`, `relatedTo`, `duplicateOf` as single UUIDs, "Blocks" as reverse lookup)
- **IssueCommunicationCard.vue**: PrimeVue TabView with Comments and Activity Log tabs
- **IssueFutureFieldsCard.vue**: Placeholder for future fields with dashed border styling

**Reusable Subcomponents:**
- **StatusBadge.vue**: Color-coded badge for Status enum values
- **TypeBadge.vue**: Color-coded badge for Type enum values

### Data Flow & Conventions

- **Props Down, Events Up**: Parent passes data via props, children emit events for actions
- **Component Syntax**: Use `<script setup>` with TypeScript
- **Props**: Define with `defineProps<T>()`
- **State**: Local reactive state with `ref()` and `computed()`
- **Styling**: PrimeVue Card + TailwindCSS utilities
- **Layout**: `grid grid-cols-12 gap-4`, cards span `col-span-12`
- **Typography**: Titles `font-semibold text-xl`, labels `font-medium text-gray-700`
- **i18n**: All user-facing text via `$t()` from vue-i18n
